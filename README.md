# noOS
A operating system made from scratch that teaches the user how computers were meant to be used.

# Installation
You don't

# Building
just run ```sh ./build.sh```

# Running in a VM
You can do that just run build.sh, and then you can use the built in script run.sh to run it with qemu, if you want to run it in VirtualBox just change the extension of `boot_sect.bin` to `boot_sect.img` and load the system as the floppy.
